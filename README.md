# laff
this should be a project to write a lexical analyser in C. This should create a really fast lexical analyser for mathmatical expressions. The Program will be benchmarked with a lexer generated by "lex".

## Concept

This Program should do the lexical analysis of any given Lexems and afters save the cleaned string as a file which can be picked up by the parser.
Input should a list of tokens of any formal language which will be processed by the lexer.
